# Boxybox

Need to create boxes in boxes in boxes in boxes?  Great news! You've found a gem that does just that.  This is a dive into the world of command line apps using TTY focusing on the tty-box and supporting gems.  This has been done in a way to extend out the customization of each box quite easily by adding additional root properties to the boxes.  For the purpose of this exercise I've chosen to stick with just the examples given in the challenge as well as the ability to craft new box nesting patterns by supplying custom JSON configs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'boxybox'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install boxybox

## Usage



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
